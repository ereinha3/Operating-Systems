# Project 3: Advanced Operating System Concepts

This project explores advanced operating system concepts through multiple implementations divided into four main parts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into four main parts:

- `part1/`: First implementation component
- `part2/`: Second implementation component
- `part3/`: Third implementation component
- `part4/`: Fourth implementation component

## Documentation

- `P3 - Description.pdf`: Detailed project requirements and specifications
- `p3reportFinal.pdf`: Comprehensive project report and analysis

## Implementation Details

Each part of the project focuses on different aspects of operating system concepts:

### Part 1
Implementation of basic operating system functionality.

### Part 2
Advanced memory management and process synchronization.

### Part 3
File system implementation and management.

### Part 4
System call implementation and kernel-level programming.

## Building and Running

Each part contains its own build instructions and can be run independently. Please refer to the individual README files within each part's directory for specific instructions.

## Project Report

A detailed analysis of the implementation, challenges faced, and results can be found in `p3reportFinal.pdf`. This includes:
- Design decisions
- Implementation challenges
- Performance analysis
- Testing results

## Requirements

Please refer to `P3 - Description.pdf` for detailed requirements and specifications for each part of the project.
