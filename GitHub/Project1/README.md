The pseudo-shell is a single-threaded, synchronous, command-line interface that allows the user to perform a limited set of functions centered around file system navigation, manipulation, and I/O. In this project I was tasked with creating a command-line interface that could operate as the Linux terminal would. Input can either be read from standard input or from a file containing given input commands. For the purpose of this project, command scope was limited to only commands: ls, pwd, mkdir, cd, cp, mv, rm, cat. These commands functioned as the would in the terminal and printed output to either an output file or standard output, depending on the mode the program was iniated in. The project was created as part of the CS415 Operating Systems course at the University of Oregon, taught by Professor Allen Malony and is intended for educational purposes only.
