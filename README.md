# CS 415: Operating Systems
## University of Oregon

This repository contains my coursework and projects for CS 415: Operating Systems at the University of Oregon. The course covers fundamental concepts of operating systems including process management, memory management, file systems, and concurrent programming.

## Project Overview

### [Project 1: Command Parser and String Manipulation](./Project1/)
A command-line interface implementation that simulates basic shell functionality. This project focuses on:
- Command parsing and tokenization
- Memory management and leak prevention
- File system operations (ls, pwd, mkdir, cd, cp, mv, rm, cat)
- Input/output redirection
- Error handling and validation

### [Project 2: Process Scheduling Implementation](./Project2/)
Implementation of various process scheduling algorithms demonstrating core OS concepts:
- Process creation and management
- First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling
- Round Robin scheduling
- Priority-based scheduling
- Multi-level feedback queue
- CPU-bound and I/O-bound process simulation
- Performance analysis of different scheduling algorithms

### [Project 3: Advanced Operating System Concepts](./Project3/)
A comprehensive project exploring advanced OS concepts through four main components:
- Basic OS functionality implementation
- Advanced memory management and process synchronization
- File system implementation and management
- System call implementation and kernel-level programming
- Multi-threaded transaction processing
- Inter-process communication
- Signal handling and process coordination
